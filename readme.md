## Installation

You should have a C++ compiler installed as this code relies on C/C++ extensions that need to be compiled. This code has been tested with [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) on Windows and GCC on linux.

Follow this step to install pytorch stardist:

1. Download the repo
2. Create a conda environment using the file `environment.yml`:
   `conda env create --file environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment and install the package `stardist_tools`:

   ```
   conda activate pytorch-stardist
   cd stardist_tools_
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Training and Inference

### Notebooks

The notebooks at `examples/3D` and `examples/2D` show in details how to perform training and inference.

### Command line scipts

You can also use command line script.

Let's download some data for the demonstration:

```
python download_demo_data.py
```

#### Training

You need a YAML file containing the training configurations to run the `train.py` script . Check `confs\dsb2018_2d.yml` and `confs\demo_3d.yml` for examples of configuration files.

Run the following command to train the model with the configurations in `confs\dsb2018.yml`:

```
python train.py --yaml_conf .\confs\dsb2018.yml
```

It will train a starDist2D model on a subsample of the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset.

#### Inference

We can perform predictions with the trained model using:

```
python predict.py --name dsb2018 --checkpoints_dir .\checkpoints --image_dir .\datasets\dsb2018\test\images --result_dir .\datasets\dsb2018\preds --use_gpu --use_amp
```

`--name dsb2018` indicates the name of the experiment given in the YAML configuration file used for the training.

## Notes

- The code is inspired by [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) and [stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist)
- The code in the folder `stardist_tools_` is from the [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) repo.
